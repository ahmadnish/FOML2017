# Machine Learning Project 2017
## General Guidelines

- cross-validate everything
- if an algorithm has tunable parameters, create precision-recall graphs (with cross validation these should give nice graphs with uncertainty regions)
- look at failure modes of eaech algorithm and compare to others, this will require communication between us
- structure of tex document:
introduction, theory of algorithms, data exploration, results of algorithms with comparison, closing notes

## Algorithms that we wanted to check out:

- Baye's Classifier
- LDA
- QDA
- (k-) nearest Neighbour
- Logistic Regression
- Histograms
- Density Trees
- SVM (linear and kernel)
- Boosting / Ensemble methods? random forests?
